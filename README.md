# Rubik-s-cube


Intro: Describe your approach – object-oriented design and logical steps (scramble → solve).
Cube Structure: Show how each face is represented.
Rotation Logic: Explain rotateFace() and how it updates both the face and adjacent sides.
Scramble & Solve: Demo both. Explain the solving algorithm is just a placeholder.
Future Work: Mention the potential to integrate real solving algorithms like Beginner’s Method, Kociemba, or Thistlethwaite.
